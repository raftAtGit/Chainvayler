* remove runtime dependency to Javassist. at the moment $sig in injected code requires javassist.runtime.Desc, god knows why. 
* add a clock facility to be used instead of System.currentTimeMillis(). stopping the clock during tx seems as the best option.
* remove previously injected code when compiler is re-run. at the moment the injected methods and fields are removed 
but the code injected into constructors is not removed. also field initializers is not removed due to a Javaassist bug: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JASSIST-140
* a serious flaw above: when compiler is re-run on same class and previosly added @Persist and @Synch methods are removed,
original methods are lost!! (Fixed for now not re-compiling if a class is already compiled for same root. a more detailed check is necessary I suppose)
* seems as PersistInSynchException can be relaxed with synching on root at @Persist methods. this will have a slight 
overhead but will be much user friendly. making this behaviour default but optional in compiler makes sense.
* proper encapsulation. at the moment many things are public and anyone can crash the system with a simple cast and java call
* more tests
* maybe a better trick to prevent GC
* cleanup and optimize compiler code. also add a command line parser, help and options. my old ComLineArgs came to rescue :)
* ant build.xml (or maven?)
* an ant task for compiler
* support for spring dependency injection (at least injecting root as a bean to other spring beans)
* some documentation
* adapt prevayler samples to postvayler
* debug info in instrumented code, so debugging and breakpoints will be more understandable
* runtime bytecode injection via javaagent or custom class loader. this is partially done again as a proof of concept but cannot cooperate with another agent at the moment. 
* classloader for above seems impossible? but not Spring's instrumentation class loaders seem possible. as they load class with delegating to parent and throw away.  
* check language spec if it's ok to throw a checked exception from an undeclared method (found nothing relevant in spec)
* check language spec if GC can break in current design. even if so, we can always trick GC not collect our objects ;)  (found nothing relevant in spec)
* follow the white TODO's in the code ;)
* what else?


* a second thinking suggests that, compiling against a specific root is not actually necessary. root class can be wrapped 
in a container with the pool and the two can be used as preveyler's root.
